## Special Thanks

None of this would be possible without some other great people who have come before me. We really do stand on the shoulders of giants. In no particular order, a big thank you goes out to:

* Limetech for creating unRAID
* All of the community developers that make unRAID what it is
* The users and people on forums/reddit who upvote and reply to content just to say that it's good
* Github and netlify for making sites like this possible _for free_!
* Lots of others I have forgot to mention.

...and of course, all of the people who have contribted directly!
